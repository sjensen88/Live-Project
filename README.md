Live Project 

The client, Utility Construction, is a commercial construction firm in need of a new website, a lead conversion landing page, and an updated logo that reflects their modern construction company. 

I created an updated version of Utility Construction's existing logo using Photoshop. They liked the overall design of their previous logo, but wanted to replace the residential graphic with imagery that reflects their commercial and architectural construction. I updated the graphic with a vector image of modern commercial buildings and updated the font to something that felt strong, reliable and modern. 

Next I created a landing page which would generate leads for architectural design. The overall goal was to give enough information on the page and a call to action (i.e., signing up for a free estimate) so that the user does not have to navigate away from the page. I first created a wireframe using paper and pencil. I then put it all together in Photoshop along with the logo and created layouts for desktop, tablet and mobile views. 

Next, I created a Home page containing a navbar, frequent and visible call to actions, a featured project page, a project highlights page, and a form to sign up for their newsletter. I used Adobe XD and created layouts for desktop, tablet and mobile.

Lastly, I built a Construction page which would showcase additional projects, their mission statement, and a staff page. The bottom of the page contained a form for the user to request a quote. I used Adobe XD and created layouts for desktop, tablet and mobile.
